<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Our Beliefs</h1>

<div class="text-center" style="margin-bottom: 5em;">
As a new church in Woodinville, we hope to continue <br />
Christ's great commission of making disciples. <br />
That is our purpose. Our preference is to do it together!

    God Is Real
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-8 belief-body">
    We believe that there is one God who exists eternally in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We call this mystery the Trinity. God created everything for His glory, including us, whom He loves dearly.  

    <div class="belief-verses">(John 1:1-4; John 14:16-17, Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19; Matthew 3:13-17; Isaiah 43:7; John 3:16-17)</div>

    Sin is the Problem
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-8 belief-body">
    We believe that all people are sinners by nature and choice. Unfortunately, the deserved penalty for our sin is death and separation from God. So without God stepping in to help, we are helpless to regain a right relationship with Him. 

    <div class="belief-verses">(Psalm 51:5; Romans 3:23; Isaiah 53:6; Isaiah 59:1-2; James 1:14-15; Ephesians 2:1-3)</div>

    Jesus is the Answer
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-8 belief-body">
    We believe that Jesus, the sinless Son of God, was born of a virgin, executed on a cross, which paid the price of sin that we should've paid, and then buried in a borrowed tomb. The good news is that He didn't stay dead. Through his resurrection we are offered a renewed relationship with God through faith and the forgiveness of sin. 

    <div class="belief-verses">(Hebrews 4:15; Isaiah 7:14; Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:1-4; 1 Timothy 2:5-6; John 1:29)</div>

    The Church is God's People
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-8 belief-body">
    We believe the church is not a building, event, or institution. It is God's family, made up of those who trust in Jesus, are baptized, and made new by the power of the Holy Spirit. The primary purpose of the church is to share the good news of Jesus to this broken world. 

    <div class="belief-verses">(Ephesians 2:19, 22, 5:25-27; Matthew 16:15-19; Acts 2:38-41; Matthew 28:18-20)</div>

    The Holy Spirit is our Helper
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-8 belief-body">
    We believe the Holy Spirit is present in the world today, active in every believer. He is our helper who opens our ears to hear God's truth, brings conviction to turn away from sin, comforts us in moments of struggle, and empowers us to carry God's hope to all those who are hurting.

    Jesus is Coming Back
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-8 belief-body">
    We believe that Jesus is very much alive, having ascended into heaven after fulfilling His mission here on earth. We eagerly await the day He returns to establish His eternal kingdom, eliminate sin entirely, and takes us home to the place he's been preparing for us.  

    <div class="belief-verses">(Revelation 1:18; Acts 1:9-11; Philippians 3:20; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Hebrews 9:28; John 14:3)</div>

    Heaven is our Home
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-8 belief-body">
    We believe everyone is created to live forever. We will either exist eternally separated from God in a place called hell, or through faith in Jesus we will be reunited to live forever with Him in heaven where He will wipe away every tear from every eye. 

    <div class="belief-verses">(Philippians 3:20; John 11:26; Revelation 20:11-15; Ephesians 2:8-9; John 14:3; Revelation 21:4)</div>

  <div class="col-sm-4 belief-header">
    The Bible is God's Word
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-8 belief-body">
    We believe the entire Bible is the inspired Word of God and that men were moved by the Holy Spirit to write the very words of Scripture. Therefore, we believe the Bible is without error and the supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct.
