<p>Groups at Arbor all point in one direction.  We are making disciples… together.  This involves finding Jesus and following Jesus.  When you sign-up for an Arbor group, you will be walking through our “groups lifecycle” together in community.</p>  

<p>BELONG
Your group begins by establishing TRUST with each other.  

Trust is built in a group of people through time spent getting to know each other in casual, often informal ways.  This will be the foundational building block for a successful group. 

EXAMPLES: dinner conversation cards || sermon questions  || group activity</p>

<p>BELIEVE
After you have spent some time getting to know each other, you will EXPERIENCE the Good News of JESUS together

This is done through a shared learning experience.  We are meant to grow our faith in community.  During the “Believe” life cycle of your group, you will go through Bible reading/ study plan or continue to review the Sunday sermon.   During this time, we will be intentional about learning and growing together.

EXAMPLES: Video Bible Study || S.O.A.P Bible Reading Plan  || Book Bible Study</p>

<p>BECOME
We have spent time learning.  Now it is time to APPLY what we know.  

This is done through an application-driven experience.  If God’s greatest commandments were to love God and love others, we will need to do something about our neighbor who is far from God or that elderly man who lives in isolation grieving the loss of his wife.  The world is aching for the hope of Jesus; what a privilege to be the ones to offer that hope.

EXAMPLES: Service Project || Application orientated curriculum
