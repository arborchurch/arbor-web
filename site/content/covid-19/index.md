Arbor Family,

{{< img-full "tent-church" >}}

It's fun to see plans becoming reality for TENT CHURCH. The state guidelines have been studied, the tents are ordered,
and soon the stage will be set for weekly gatherings starting JULY 12. For those who are ready to connect in person,
these Sunday viewing services will meet the need! We have a seat for you, and even a mask if you forget yours, but
definitely bring your own coffee. You'll love the outdoor sanctuary... the grassy yard is ringed with evergreen trees
and there's even a campfire in the middle... it feels very "on brand" for Arbor! 

Since many aren't feeling quite ready for this in-person experience, our online services will continue indefinitely! As
much as we can, we want to be a both/and church in this season. Stream us on Facebook and YouTube from your own campfire
for optimal results.

If you are able to VOLUNTEER on Sunday mornings, we want you. Help with parking, greeting, and seating are the major
needs.... email <info@arborchurch.com> to sign up!

Last weekend was our launch of ARBOR ADVENTURES for KIDS, and if you're a kid, we want you to invite you along. Every
Sunday at noon, we're zooming through Genesis and Exodus, enjoying crafts, stories, and worship filmed inside the
Orchard, Grove and Thicket! You'll see your favorite leaders there, and breakout rooms will be fun hangout times with
your friends. 

Keeping kids connected to their faith community is important, which is why we created this space and time. Arbor
Adventures will help your child bridge the distance until we're back together again. 

Zoom at noon here: <https://tinyurl.com/arborkidszoom>. See you there!

They say this season is "unprecedented," and in keeping with that trend, we are going OFFLINE over the July 4th weekend.
The staff is hitting the pause button with our families before we pivot into Tent Church, so there will be no service
online. 

Thank you for your understanding in this, Arbor! Ordinarily, our team staggers time off in the summer, but the current
workflow doesn't permit that. We need to be ALL IN or ALL OUT for our current ministry framework, so it made sense to
break over the holiday.

God seems to have wired us for seasons of rest, hasn't He? Our hope is that each of YOU also finds time soon for that
and your soul would be refreshed. This summer seems we need it more than ever!

See you Sunday,

The Arbor Team
