Arbor Family...

It seems these "unprecedented days" are continuing to get even more uprecedented, aren't they? Underlying racial tensions across the country emerge amidst pandemic concerns; protests and violence have landed in our own backyard. Our attention is captured, our spirits convicted... we have a lot to learn about racial reconciliation.

To that end, we are pivoting this Sunday to address the subject of racism. Scott Hetherington was already slated to speak in our BEGIN AGAIN series, but as the week's events unfolded, he scrapped his old sermon and began again. Only God could have presecheduled a pastor who serves on a diversity and equity committee to speak this week! Scott is well versed in the subject at hand, and it will be impactful for him to lead us in the conversation.

On JUNE 14th we're hosting a FAMILY MEETING to share some churchwide updates, among them our plans to reopen the building. It's been a long time since we've "met" together! Though it's just through a Zoom screen, we're excited to see your faces starting at 7pm. We can't wait to be current and talk about the work God is doing in and through Arbor.

We'll send the Zoom link just prior to the meeting that night; simply reply to this email now to be included.

We still marvel every week that God has placed our little church in the FOOD BANK business! We think Arbor is particularly suited to this pandemic-time ministry; we're small enough to be nimble, generous enough to be impactful. Every week we've consistently generated a sizable pantry for the 30 families at Woodin Elementary to draw from. Not only do we provide the basics, we've also been able to bless with homemade cloth masks, children's crafts, and Mother Day treats. 

Thank you for continuing to support this ongoing work! As you know, tummies are ever-hungry, and food insecurity is the #1 concern in our community at this time. As you grocery shop, throw something into your cart for the bank and drop it at Arbor 24/7! Your participation is hugely appreciated.

Gratefully,

The Arbor Team
