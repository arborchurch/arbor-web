Hello Arbor Family, 

Like so many others this week, we are flexing the way we do things... at least for the time being. We aren't **CANCELING** church, we're just **CHANGING** the way we do it!

Last week we hosted hundreds of you via **LIVESTREAM** and yes... it was a little rough. The audio wasn't in sync, and we were bumped offline for a few minutes, but we prevailed and finished strong. Not only do we feel we fixed these issues, we spent the week improving the quality of what you'll see. You'll find out along with the rest of us how well we did at 9 and 11am! We'll broadcast on our services on our website, on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRe_QiHhuGwlIY43ECFopNQ), and on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/arborchurchnw/).

Any kids in the crowd? We'll also have activities for them on our livestream link as well. 

Church is more than Sunday services, as you know... it is the expression of God's love to the people who surround us. We want to **BE THE CHURCH** to those in need, and you are invited to join us in that effort.

Clearly, the **SENIOR POPULATION** is deeply impacted by this pandemic. We are providing weekly blessing baskets for the staffs at Lakeview and Vineyard Park; ArborGroups will also be creating care packages for the residents there. It's hard to be quarantined even when you're young and can figure out how to work your remote control! They could use some love from the outside world.

Paychecks are taking a hit for many in our local area, so we have established a **TEXT TO GIVE** opportunity to help out. 100% of your donation will go to families being impacted by income loss... simply text in a dollar amount to **84321**.

Lastly, food scarcity is a reality for many children in our backyard. The schools that have been a nourishment bridge to hungry families is now disrupted. Filling the **FOOD BANK** at Woodin Elementary School fills a critical void. Donations may be dropped off at Arbor during office hours and volunteers will deliver them to the school. A suggested donation list is below.

Know we are praying for **YOU** in this. Your faith is giving you a resilience and hope that cannot be found on a grocery store shelf. Thank you for stepping in to help; you are making an impact for God's glory and the good of others. Take rest in the perspective of 2 Corinthians 4:17: *This light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison.*

May it be so! See you online Sunday.

The Arbor Team
