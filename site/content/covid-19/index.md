I wanted to personally reach out on behalf Arbor's leadership to give you some updates from your church family. It's been a rough week or two, and we're mindful that you may be feeling confused, worried, and upset. Hopefully, you've also felt a stronger measure of God's presence and comfort... we have been praying hard for that to happen.

The news that broke last week about Jake's resignation came as a surprise to us all. We sought to inform leaders, donors, and volunteers as fast as possible in a Zoom meeting, and then emailed a broader circle the following day. Please forgive us if your email address was not captured in our data grab.... one downside to online church is our attendance records aren't accurately updated.

We'd like to invite you to a Followup Family Meeting this Tuesday at 8pm on Zoom. The Transition Team has received your questions (have any? email them to TransitionTeam@arborchurch.com), and would like a chance to answer them. Email us for the Zoom link. It will be a time to not just unpack the situation at hand, but also share Arbor's plans for the future. 

Spoiler alert: we may have lost a leader, but we have not lost our Leader.

.... and so, our tender little churchplant has had its first crisis. Though our goal all along has been to HELP THE HURTING, we didn't expect to be the ones needing help on a group level. We didn't expect 2020 to hit this low; the collective trauma is deeply wounding.

I chose the graphic above to represent the grit and mess that goes into tending the roots of a hurting plant. Arbor's leadership is not the only one bent over to minister to those in pain... it is the Lord Jesus Christ who is meeting us here. It is HIS hands that are gently guiding us, binding up our weeping wounds... it is HIS Spirit abiding with us, giving peace and comfort. The Church is His beloved, and He will not leave us. Healing work is messy, but if there ever has been a church who is "okay to not be okay," it is Arbor! We were planted in the soil of grief and watered with tears.... God established us, grew us, strengthened us, and He will again. It is by His hand and for His glory that we will once again flourish.

Please make sure to heal along with us on Sunday at our online campus (9 & 11am), Facebook, or Youtube. We are also reaching out to you daily across our platforms with content to encourage and connect with you. Our focus for the rest of 2020 is to grieve and heal... and also to seek God's direction through prayer. Speaking of that, our staff and Transition Team is here to process and pray with you... our fantastic Prayer Team is as well.

Here for you, 

Alison, for the Team
