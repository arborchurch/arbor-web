In our last survey, we polled parents about best times for ArborKids Online to air. Overwhelmingly, we heard a need for kids to have their program running while their grownups were engaging in their own service.... therefore, 8:50am is now go-time! This will allow parents to help their children online and settled, brew a cup of coffee, and then begin streaming their own worship service at 9:30.

Kids can meet with their leaders on Zoom to learn about God, engage in exciting worship together, and have a bunch of fun connecting through online games, challenges and sharing! ** Join us on Zoom (https://zoom.us/join)
by entering our Zoom room number: 5095540648.

Parents, if you add your childâ€™s name and age number before signing on, we can better place your kids with other kids that are friends or kids closer to their age! We'll see you at 8:50am this Sunday!

Just a reminder this is the LAST WEEK to sign up for a Group! There seems to be something for almost everyone, with options to meet both on campus and via zoom. This season of connection will run October to Thanksgiving... the perfect timing to reconnect with your church family!

Bible studies, DivorceCare, GriefShare, recovery support... groups for couples or families, groups for men, for women... for men and women! Engaging relationally with your faith community builds hope, encouragement, and a greater sense of God's presence, all of which are deeply needed in 2020.

In all the months we've stocked the Food Bank at Woodin Elementary, we've never seen bare shelves... until THIS week. Thirty families swept through on Thursday, wiping out our contributions and requiring us to go hard after replenishing donations now.

We consider these folks part of our extended family, as are the seniors we support at the Northshore Senior Center. Their needs are ours to meet; we are honored with this responsibility. In fact, we keep in mind the words of Jesus in ** Matthew 25 (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A37-40&version=NLT)
... when we feed the hungry or serve "the least of these," we serve Jesus Himself.

Pandemics are hard, but giving should not be. Donations are accepted 24/7 at the back door of Arbor. On behalf of hungry families, thank you!

"See you" Sunday on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/arborchurchnw) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRe_QiHhuGwlIY43ECFopNQ/featured)! Service begins at 9:30 but is viewable at any point after that if you accidentally sleep in.

Go Hawks!
