Hello Arbor Family,

As our previous email indicated, we have kept a close eye on the recommendations from the State Department of Public Health and the CDC in regards to the coronavirus (COVID-19) and public gatherings. This has clearly had an impact on all of us, including churches. Our elders and staff have been prayerfully weighing our response to this ever-changing landscape. Here's the updated plan moving forward.

### Sunday Services

Earlier in the week, we had hoped to meet this Sunday as a family. We sterilized and cleaned every nook and cranny of the church as if we'd be together. At the same time, we also prepared for an alternative by moving quickly to establish an online live-streaming system. I'm happy we did so.

After a lot of prayer and discussion, **services will be ONLINE ONLY** starting this Sunday (March 8 at 9 & 11am). Our hope is to be able to gather together again as soon as possible, but in the meantime, we can still come together as a church by worshipping in our homes with friends and family. If you'll be watching the livestream on Facebook, we encourage you to share it on your feed. If you'll be watching on our website, consider inviting someone to join you by sending them the link.

In addition to the livestream, we want to come alongside and help provide ways for your kiddos to grow spiritually.  Below are a couple of links to a **Children's ministry experience** that you can watch with your kids. We'll have more resources for families in next week's communication.

### Mid-Week Ministries

Thus far we've been following the Northshore School District's calendar and closure schedules. Because they are **suspending all on-campus activity**, we will do the same. Arbor Students, Women's Bible Study and Celebrate Recovery will not meet this week. We will evaluate this decision week to week as the situation around the outbreak continues to unfold. Groups will continue to meet unless determined otherwise by their leader since the recommendations are to avoid large gatherings. Small gatherings have no restrictions at this point. â€¨


### Helping the Hurting

As a church, we don't see this as a time to huddle up and hibernate in our homes. We see it as an opportunity to step up and help. This begins in our backyard. If you are able and willing to lend a hand, here are **2 WAYS you can contribute**.

1. **GIVE FOOD:** With some schools out of session, low-income families are losing their access to free and reduced lunches. We've decided to help refill the food banks at Woodin Elementary which provides nourishment during this season. Feel free to drop off your donation at the church during Arbor hours, and we'll take it from there. (canned protein, cereal, peanut butter, pasta, rice, toilet paper, shampoo, laundry soap)
2. **GIVE FINANCES:** Due to health-imposed restrictions, not everyone is able to continue working and receive a paycheck. With Northshore schools being closed, many parents will need to stay home to care for their children. If you'd like to contribute financially, you can do so by texting a dollar amount to 84321. 100% of your donations will go to help these families in need.

**LET US HELP YOU**: If you happen to be in need, please let us know. We'd like to come alongside if you are (or someone you know is) losing a paycheck or quarantined. Simply email us at <info@arborchurch.com>.

### In Closing

It may seem like the world is a little bit crazy right now. Life as we know it feels sideways, which may lead you to feeling anxious. So before signing off, I want to remind us that we are not alone in this storm. **When our faith in SOMEONE exceeds our fear of SOMETHING, fear loses its grip.** That someone is Jesus Christ, and He promises to never leave us nor forsake us. With Christ in our lives, fear can take a backseat. Remember the words of the Apostle Paul:

> Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your
requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in
Christ Jesus. -Philippians 4:6-7

In this together,

Jake
