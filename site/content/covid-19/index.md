Arbor Family...

If you joined us for last week's FAMILY MEETING, you got a sneak peak on the plans to regather as a church family. God has provided a way for us to be together on Sunday mornings this summer... we are calling it TENT CHURCH!

{{< img-full "tent-church" >}}

We're creating a summer full of connection opportunities while adhering to health and safety guidelines, and Tent Church is the cornerstone. An Arbor family has generously lent their property to create our outdoor sanctuary, and we're working overtime to prepare a place for you. More details will be forthcoming, but mark your calendar for Sundays at 9:30am, beginning JULY 12th. We will be masked, we will be 6 feet apart... but we will be TOGETHER! For those who feel unready to gather, services will continue indefinitely online on both YouTube and Facebook. 

If you missed the Family Meeting and would love the nitty gritty details about how we arrived at this solution, you can listen to the recording HERE.

As families know, kids are fairly impossible to social distance with, and mask rules are hard to keep. Thus, Children's Ministry won't resume for awhile on Sunday mornings; kiddos can either join their parents at Tent Church and or come along on ARBOR'S ADVENTURES FOR KIDS! 

Each Sunday at noon you'll journey with ArborKids and their leaders, zooming through Genesis and Exodus. Games, crafts, worship and breakout sessions will be led in familiar places like the Orchard and Grove, helping kids make connections to their church home turf.

The fun starts THIS SUNDAY, and can be found at this link: www.arborkidszoom. Questions? Email Michael here, or join the ArborKids Facebook group for all the breaking news. Can't wait to adventure with you!

Arbor Students, we haven't forgotten about you! Starting NEXT THURSDAY and running through the summer, incoming 6th-12th graders are invited to OUTSIDE SERVICE at Mindy's house! The fun starts at 7pm, and parents can pick between 8:30-9pm.

Directions are HERE and any questions can be emailed to Bryan. Yes, masks will be required, and yes, social distancing respected! We want to be good stewards of this opportunity to gather... something we're incredibly grateful for!

Looking forward to an amazing summer!

The Arbor Team
