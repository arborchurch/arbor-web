Dear Arbor Family,

There's been a lot of change recently, and you're doing a great job flexing with each day's news. You're working from home, schooling your kids, and staying six feet apart. We have been praying for you in this isolating season to sense Jesus nearer than ever, strengthening and equipping you... and keeping you safe.

We've made some changes at Arbor as well. We're going to mesh our regular two Sunday services into only **ONE LIVESTREAM SERVICE at 9:30am.** This virtually brings our whole Arbor family together at once, which feels all the more meaningful given the circumstances. You can find our livestream on our [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/arborchurchnw), on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRe_QiHhuGwlIY43ECFopNQ), or here on our website. Don't forget to submit prayer requests or care needs on the [Connection Card](https://arborchurch.churchcenter.com/people/forms/110195) as well! We want to stay in touch.

When the whole world pushes the **STOP** button because of crisis, the local church pushes **PLAY**. Pain, fear, lack, and panic have a remedy... and the church is ready to be the expression of Christ to those around us. We are creating SENIOR CARE PACKAGES for residents in two assisted living facilities, filling the local FOOD BANK, providing FINANCES to those who've lost paychecks, and delivering STAFF BLESSING BASKETS to schools and senior facilities. It's never been more important for Arbor to faithfully continue to give than right now so we meet the needs around us.

Banks can set up **AUTOMATIC** payments in a snap, or **ONLINE** gifts can be made here on website (click Give in the upper right). Have a check, an envelope, and a stamp? Combine those and pop them in the **MAIL** to:

>  19011 Woodinville Snohomish Road NE, Suite 210, Woodinville WA 98072.

One expression of love we are giving to our community comes in the form of **FOOD**. Our local school, Woodin Elementary, has a food bank that provides nourishment to the families directly in our back yard. Now more than ever, food scarcity is a concern! Targeting this need to meet is a practical and essential form of support.

As we've learned, families using food stamps cannot purchase the very things most of us have stocked up on: TP, diapers, wipes, hygiene, and cleaning products. This week's shopping list features these products in addition to non-perishable pantry items. Cookies are on the list after a food resource consultant reminded us of the comfort a sweet can give a child in crisis. We can all relate to that, can't we?

Thank you for your lavish love and generosity! Donations can be dropped during office hours.

"See you" Sunday morning at 9:30!

Keep washing those hands!

The Arbor Team
