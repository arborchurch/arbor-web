Hello Arbor Family,

We have been completely amazed by the outpouring of your generosity the past couple of weeks! Times have been hard, but
you have rallied to provide for not just your church home, but to the neighbors surrounding it. Major needs have been
met, such as providing supplemental food to the free/reduced lunch families at Woodin Elementary School. Because of the
Stay At Home order, we are the sole supplier to their **FOOD BANK**. Each Thursday, carloads full of food, toiletries,
paper goods, and diapers have gone directly from Arbor into the hands of needy families.

Your financial donations are also directly supporting two local **SENIOR FACILITIES**, a demographic heavily impacted by this crisis. Boredom compounds the isolation and concern these residents have, so we are delivering "love in a box" to boost their morale. Puzzles, books, DVDs, and snacks are safely arriving to their doorstep, along with homemade cards from ArborKids. We know the facility staff works extra hard in such a season, so they are also receiving weekly baskets full of special foods and beverages.

Staying at home is one way to benefit the community; donating financial resources is another. Click [ONLINE GIVING](https://arborchurch.churchcenteronline.com/giving?open-in-church-center-modal=true) to donate a one time gift or set up regular giving. Thank you, Arbor!

We know you've been making a lot of changes in your daily life recently.... some that have added a bit of stress. The newsfeeds can be discouraging, and yet we need to turn online for the social nearness that we miss.

Arbor wants to meet you in that space as a way to offer encouragement. Every morning at 8am, look for a DAILY DEVO on Arbor's [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/arborchurchnw/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/arborchurchnw/) accounts. There you'll find some familiar faces... but even better, you'll find the kind of news that feeds your soul.

Easter is just around the corner! Though we're planning to celebrate **ONLINE** with you, we're having fun creating special elements that will make the morning memorable.

Plan to meet us at **9:30am on April 12th** from your favorite virtual worship venue - couch, kitchen table, or exercise bike! Easter bonnets optional.

We'll see you 9:30am this Sunday as well! Find and follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/arborchurchnw/) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRe_QiHhuGwlIY43ECFopNQ) for front row seats.

Praying wellness in all ways for you,

The Arbor Team
