<h2 class="tight-header">Thursday Nights</h2> from 7-9pm.

<br>

WE LOVE STUDENTS! We are determined to provide a place for teenagers to connect with God, other students, and older committed leaders who are dedicated to seeing them grow closer to Christ. It's a safe place to learn about Jesus, make some life-long friends, and of course, have fun.

Every Thursday at 7pm this summer, middle school and high school students combine for crazy games and an interactive message about Jesus at a location outside. We have outside games and a fire pit to roast s'mores. Students can bring their own lawn chairs to sit comfortably and show off the best ones! There is plenty of space outside for everyone to invite their friends so they can have outside safely!

During this COVID season, all students and leaders will be wearing masks while practicing social distancing. We have hand washing stations and plenty of hand sanitizers. We will have masks if students forget them! We even have our s'mores practicing social distancing! We are doing everything we can so our students can gather together safely and hear about Jesus!

However, if students are not comfortable to gather in person, we have our services online every Thursday on Instagram live at 7:15pm. You can join in by following us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/arborstudents/).

Bottom line, we want students to feel like part of the family... because they are! Students aren't the next generation to come. They are the generation of here and now, and we want to love, invest, and point them to Jesus.

If you need the address of our outside service or have any other questions email Bryan.
