<h2 class="tight-header">Thursday Nights</h2> from 7-9pm.

<br>
<br>

WE LOVE STUDENTS! We are determined to provide a place for teenagers to connect with God, other students, and older committed leaders who are dedicated to seeing them grow closer to Christ. It's a safe place to learn about Jesus, make some life-long friends, and of course, have fun.

Every Thursday at 7pm, middle school and high school students combine for crazy games, an interactive message about Jesus, and connect in small groups! Currently, we are meeting IN-PERSON in our SANCTUARY. 

Bottom line, we want students to feel like part of the family... because they are! Students aren't the next generation to come. They are the generation of here and now, and we want to love, invest, and point them to Jesus.
