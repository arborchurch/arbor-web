We at Arbor Students are determined to provide a warm and welcoming place for all middle and high school students! Our first priority is to love God and our second priority is to love others! We seek to help our students connect with God, other peers, and committed adult leaders who are dedicated to seeing these students grow closer to Christ. As disciples of Christ who seek to disciple others, we simply set our sights on Jesus while being surrounded by friends and fun! 

Service Times: First three Sundays of the month at 10:30
