<h2 class="tight-header">Thursday Nights</h2> from 7-9pm.

<br>
<br>

WE LOVE STUDENTS! We are determined to provide a place for teenagers to connect with God, other students, and older committed leaders who are dedicated to seeing them grow closer to Christ. It’s a safe place to learn about Jesus, make some life-long friends, and of course, have fun.

Every Thursday at 7pm, middle school and high school students combine for crazy games, an interactive message about Jesus, and connect in small groups!  

During this COVID season, all students and leaders will be wearing masks while practicing social distancing. We have hand washing stations and plenty of hand sanitizers. We will have masks if students forget them! We are doing everything we can so our students can gather together safely and hear about Jesus!

Bottom line, we want students to feel like part of the family… because they are! Students aren’t the next generation to come. They are the generation of here and now, and we want to love, invest, and point them to Jesus.

If you have any other questions email Bryan.
