Acres of Diamonds is a program to support homeless moms and kids as they rebuild their lives.

The structured living plan, on-site counseling, parenting support and life-skill training helps moms to re-establish their lives with purpose, confidence, and support. Kids are also provided academic, relational, and emotional support through Acres of Diamonds programs.

The Woodinville Storehouse Food Bank is operated by a coalition of churches and denominations serving the local community by providing nourishment and ministry to those in need.

We are a Christian organization that provides fresh food and prayer support to members of our community. 

Anyone who is experiencing food insecurity is invited to become a client for as long as they need. We provide quality food including dairy, baked goods, produce, meat and vegetables. 

Clients are treated with respect and care by volunteers who are equipped to pray for them if desired.
