Arbor Family,

It's been a rough few weeks, and we're mindful that you may be feeling confused, worried, and upset about the changes taking place. Hopefully, you've also felt a strong, increasing measure of God's presence and comfort... we have been praying hard for that to happen.

The news that broke about Jake's resignation the first week of November came as a surprise to us all. We sought to inform leaders, donors, and volunteers as fast as possible via a Zoom meeting, and then emailed a broader circle the following day. 

We formed a Transition Team to help navigate the choppy waters and steer us wherever the Lord desires. This Transition Team is here for you to answer any questions... simply reach out via email and they will connect with you as soon as possible (transitionteam@arborchurch.com).

Spoiler alert: we may have lost a leader, but we have not lost our Leader.

.... and so, our tender little churchplant has had its first crisis. Though our goal all along has been to HELP THE HURTING, we didn't expect to be the ones needing help on a group level. We didn't expect 2020 to hit this low; the collective trauma is deeply wounding.

The graphic above represents the grit and mess that goes into tending the roots of a hurting plant. Arbor's leadership is not the only one bent over to minister to those in pain... it is the Lord Jesus Christ who is meeting us here. It is HIS hands that are gently guiding us, binding up our weeping wounds... it is HIS Spirit abiding with us, giving peace and comfort. The Church is His beloved, and He will not leave us. Healing work is messy, but if there ever has been a church who is "okay to not be okay," it is Arbor! We were planted in the soil of grief and watered with tears.... God established us, grew us, strengthened us, and He will again. It is by His hand and for His glory that we will once again flourish.

Please make sure to heal along with us on Sunday at our online campus (9 & 11am), Facebook, or Youtube. We are also reaching out to you daily across our platforms with content to encourage and connect with you. Our focus for the rest of 2020 is to grieve and heal... and also to seek God's direction through prayer. Speaking of that, our staff and Transition Team is here to process and pray with you... our fantastic Prayer Team is as well.
