W﻿e love the little town of Woodinville, and love summer nights in the community listening to good music and hanging out together. For 4 nights this summer, you'll find Arbor at Wilmot Gateway Park starting at 6'ish... bring a picnic or grab food from the trucks... bring a blanket or lawn chair.. even bring the dog! We can't wait to hang out with you.\
