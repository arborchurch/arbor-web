Summer is a revolving door in the PNW! We can't wait for everyone to come home again so we can rejoin the community rhythms here at Arbor.Â \
\
To celebrate your return, we're having a party! Come back and bring someone with you... we'll start with worship, end with ice-cream, and somewhere in the middle bounce on an inflatable and paint our faces! Hopefully it's warm enough for the (dreaded) dunk tank to emerge!
