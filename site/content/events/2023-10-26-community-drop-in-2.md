We are excited to be able to offer a community drop-in space on most Saturday nights.\
\
The Orchard will be open from 6-9pm for folks to come share food, play games, read, chat, not chat, or just be unalone together for a few hours. All ages and stages are welcome to come take advantage of this space. To learn more, ask Caleb via text (425-877-4138).
