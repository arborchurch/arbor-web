Woodinville Storehouse and Union Gospel Mission are hosting a free class in Woodinville called "Engaging Homelessness 101". \
\
We will be learning about the root causes of homelessness, along with how best to minister to this population. Local churches are invited to come so we can hopefully get on the same page and work together. \
\
The link to the registration includes a promo video. The video talks about this being a six-part series, but we are only planning on the first class at this time. Hope to see you there.
