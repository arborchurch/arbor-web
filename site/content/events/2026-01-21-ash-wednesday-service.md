A﻿sh Wednesday is one of our favorite services of the year due to its simplicity and contemplative atmosphere. Song, scripture, and prayer ready our hearts for communion and the blessing of ashes. These elements usher in the season of Lent, a time of emptying ourselves in order to more deeply understand Christ's work on the cross.
