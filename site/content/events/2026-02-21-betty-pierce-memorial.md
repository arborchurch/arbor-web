You are warmly welcome to celebrate with us the beautiful life of Betty Pierce on Saturday, February 28th at 1pm. 

Betty's Memorial will be held here at her home church, Arbor, and will also be livestreamed for those who live far away. Livestream details will be posted below when they become available.  

To honor Betty, donations can be made to her favorite causes:

Alzheimer's Association (alzfdn.org/) 
🐾Paws Wildlife Center (paws.org)

We look forward to surrounding Betty's family with love, joy, and comfort during this time. Please plan to linger after the service for hugs and refreshments!
