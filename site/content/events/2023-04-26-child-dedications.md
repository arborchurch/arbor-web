Celebrate with us as we host our next Child Dedication service on Sunday, December 21st! We believe Psalm 127:3, which says “Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from him.” \
\
Child Dedication is a time for us to celebrate and thank God for the gift of your children. It’s also a time for parents to commit to model what following Jesus looks like and to raise their children to understand what it means to be a follower of Jesus.
