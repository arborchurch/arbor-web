Good news! We have a FAMILY MEETING around the corner, and we can't wait to be together for some updates and news. We’ve created a timeframe that will optimize for an awesome turnout... it will happen somewhat as a "second half" of our Sunday worship service on **SEPT 22nd**, after an intermission of snacks & coffee refills!

The kids will continue time in their classrooms with some special programming while the grownups chat about grownup things. We hope you’ll all feel free to stay and enjoy knowing more about what your church is up to and where we’re going.
