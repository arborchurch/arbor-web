Good news! We have a FAMILY MEETING around the corner, and we can't wait to be together for some updates and news. We’ve created a timeframe that will optimize for an awesome turnout... it will happen somewhat as a "second half" of our Sunday worship service on **APRIL 28**, after an intermission of homemade cookies & coffee refills!

The kids will continue time in their classrooms with some special programming while the grownups chat about grownup things. W**GOOD NEWS** kind of meeting (although spoiler alert: the piggy bank is thin), so we hope you’ll all feel free to stay and enjoy knowing more about what your church is up to and where we’re going.
