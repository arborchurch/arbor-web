Carrying grief? Struggling to adjust to a loved one's physical absence? GRIEFSHARE may help.\
\
Arbor begins a new session of GriefShare on September 11th... its weekly Monday evenings explore topics of bereavement and healing in a gentle, faith-based community. We'll hear from well-respected grief counselors via video teaching, share with others on the same journey, and then continue to grow and heal through the week with our workbook journaling.

Alison Acone is moderating the group this season; though she's led many sessions before, she's excited to use GriefShare's newest edition of materials. The welcome mat is out for anyone in the community, not just Arbor Church family members. If you've done GriefShare before and would like to dip in again using this new content, you're warmly welcome.

To receive your workbook before the first meeting, register below.
