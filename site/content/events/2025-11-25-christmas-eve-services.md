You're warmly welcome to our traditional candlelit worship service on Christmas Eve. Children are welcomed to come - they can hold a candle OR a glowstick - but we also have toddler and preschool rooms open for those who need a freer range. \

Linger after for our hot cocoa bar and photo booth! We're looking forward to celebrating Christ's birth with you at 2pm and 4pm.
