Arbor Students will be attending our first ever Winter Retreat this winter. We will be attending Camp Ghormley March 1-3 2024. This will be a great time of fellowship, fun, but most importantly, an intentional time of growing in faith. Our aim for this camp is to retreat with Jesus as he would do many times in His ministry. Retreating to pray, be in silence, or just be in His presence. The camp cost is $260 to attend which includes the price of camp, transportation and food while at the camp. We hope your student is able to retreat with us.
