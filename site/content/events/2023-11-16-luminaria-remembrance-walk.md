The members of Arbor GriefShare invite you to join them for the Snohomish River Trail Luminaria Walk on what is known as the "Longest Night," or the winter solstice. \
\
As Christians, we turn toward the Light of Christ in dark times. Symbolically, this night represents the dark pain of grief... and so together we celebrate the Light. \
\
We will meet at Cady Park at 5pm, all bundled up, have a moment of prayer before walking the candlelit River Trail. If you feel you could use this time of community and spiritual support, please join us.
