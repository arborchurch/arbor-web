Community Serve Day is an event where local churches, schools, non-profits and businesses come together for our community. For one day, we all set aside our regular Sunday activities to help our schools prepare for the coming year by helping set up classrooms, making improvements to the campuses and more. To join the rest of the Arbor family, sign up for WOODIN ELEMENTARY and wear your Arbor hat!
