Community Serve Day is an event where local churches, schools and the community come together to help over 20 Northshore and Lake Washington schools prepare for the first day of school. For one day, we all set aside our regular Sunday activities to volunteer by weeding, spreading mulch, touching up playground paint, volunteering alongside teachers to prepare classrooms and more. \
