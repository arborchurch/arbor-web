Baptism is an outward action of an inward commitment. Following Christ has always been more than a private acknowledgement of trusting in Him for your salvation... scripture shows us time and again that outward profession of faith is the encouraged next step of faith.

D﻿ecember can be a busy month and a distraction from Christ's birth. We're grateful for a time to gather and worship during such a season, helping us recenter on the hope of Advent. Baptisms will add dimension and meaning to our joy!
