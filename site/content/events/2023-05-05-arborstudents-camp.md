Arbor Students' weekend summer camp is just around the corner and it's the perfect way for **6th-12th graders** to make new friends, create memories, and grow in their faith in Jesus. We are excited to announce that we will be returning to Miracle Ranch again this year. At Arbor, we believe that summer camp is an important part of personal growth and development, and our focus is to provide young people with opportunities to learn, grow, and build lasting relationships with Christ at the center. So if you're looking for an unforgettable summer weekend experience that combines faith and fun, join us at Miracle Ranch for a time you won't forget!\
