This is Arbor Students first ever Winter Retreat! We will be attending Camp Ghormley March 1-3, 2024. This will be a great time of fellowship, fun, but most importantly, an intentional time of growing in faith. Our aim for this camp is to retreat with Jesus as he would do many times in His ministry. The camp cost is $260 to attend which includes the price of camp, transportation, and food.
