Every year we are stoked to host our neighbors, friends, and Arborkiddos at VBS; it takes the whole Arbor village to pull it off!\
\
If you’d like to flex your leadership gifts toward this outreach event, please come to an inital **VBS PLANNING MEETING on Sunday, Feb 1** right after second service. No signup necessary! Just come and surprise Lindsey with your support. We’ve already been praying for you!
