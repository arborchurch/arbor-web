We're having a party for our Woodinville neighborhood and we'd love you to come! SUNDAY, OCTOBER 30th is our first ever TRUNK OR TREAT, happening at twilight (4-6pm) in Arbor's backyard.

If you're not familiar with this concept, this is a PNW-parent's greatest brainstorm. Streets too dangerous to trick-or-treat in because sidewalks/streetlights are an afterthought here? Houses too far apart because of all the horse-acre properties in Woodinville? Malls efficient but sterile? Voila! The TRUNK OR TREAT... held outdoors in the semi-dark, candy received out of the backs of vehicles run by safe, friendly, costumed churchfolk. Lots of cool vibes! Feels safe but also feels festive.
