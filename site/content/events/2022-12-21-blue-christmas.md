A diagnosis. A loss. Hardship. A heavy, melancholy heart.

Though December is here, many of us feel more blue than shiny tinsel. The thought of merrily celebrating Christmas doesn't seem to match the tender heaviness we carry... yet we long to bring ourselves into the peacegiving presence of Christ.

BLUE CHRISTMAS is a candlelit service held on the longest night of the year, the winter solstice. Churches open their doors on this "darkest night" to worship Jesus, the Light of the World.

Join us at Arbor on WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 21st; the sanctuary will open at 6:30 for candlelit silent prayer.... service starts at 7. Come as you are.
