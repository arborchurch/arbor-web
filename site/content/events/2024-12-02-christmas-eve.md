Oï»¿ur candlelight Christmas Eve service is simple and meaningful for each person in your family. Join us at 2:30 or 4:30 for a time of singing and the story of Christ's birth, then enjoy a cup of cheer at our hot cocoa bar. Childcare will be provided for preschoolers and toddlers in their festive classrooms, but they are also welcome in the sanctuary. They even get to hold a candle as we sing Silent Night! The sweetest memory to make.
