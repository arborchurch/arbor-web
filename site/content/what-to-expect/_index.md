Arbor is a place where people come as they are. You're welcome to wear whatever you want... just as long as it's flannel. The coffee is hot and not that bad for being free. The people are also friendly so someone will most likely say hello.

Our services typically run about an hour. There's a little bit of singing, a chance to connect, and a meaningful message centered around Jesus. You're welcome to participate in as much or as little as you like.

Our kids do the same thing in their classrooms except for the added bonus of fishy crackers! If it's your first time visiting and you have kids, we suggest arriving 15 minutes early to check them in.  

Looking forward to seeing you on Sunday!
