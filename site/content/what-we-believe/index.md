## GOD IS REAL

We believe that there is one God who exists eternally in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We call this mystery the Trinity. God created everything for His glory, including us, whom He loves dearly. 

<small>(John 1:1-4; John 14:16-17, Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19; Matthew 3:13-17; Isaiah 43:7; John 3:16-17)</small>
<br />
<br />

## SIN IS THE PROBLEM

We believe that all people are sinners by nature and choice. Unfortunately, the deserved penalty for our sin is death and separation from God. So without God stepping in to help, we are helpless to regain a right relationship with Him.

<small>(Psalm 51:5; Romans 3:23; Isaiah 53:6; Isaiah 59:1-2; James 1:14-15; Ephesians 2:1-3)</small>
<br />
<br />

## JESUS IS THE ANSWER

We believe that Jesus, the sinless Son of God, was born of a virgin, executed on a cross, which paid the price of sin that we should've paid, and then buried in a borrowed tomb. The good news is that He didn't stay dead; he rose again. Through his resurrection we are offered a renewed relationship with God through faith and the forgiveness of sin.

<small>(Hebrews 4:15; Isaiah 7:14; Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:1-4; 1 Timothy 2:5-6; John 1:29)</small>
<br />
<br />


## THE CHURCH IS GOD'S PEOPLE

We believe that the Church is not a building, event, or institution. It is God's family, made up of those who trust in Jesus, are baptized, and made new by the power of the Holy Spirit. The primary purpose of the Church is to share the good news of Jesus to this broken world.

<small>(Ephesians 2:19, 22, 5:25-27; Matthew 16:15-19; Acts 2:38-41; Matthew 28:18-20)</small>
<br />
<br />


## THE HOLY SPIRIT IS OUR HELPER

We believe the Holy Spirit is present in the world today, active in every believer. He is our helper who opens our ears to hear God's truth, brings conviction to turn away from sin, comforts us in moments of struggle, and empowers us to carry God's hope to all those who are hurting.

<small>(John 16:7-15; Ephesians 1:13-14; John 14:16-17,26; Romans 8:14-17; Acts 1:8)</small>
<br />
<br />


## JESUS IS COMING BACK

We believe that Jesus is very much alive, having ascended into heaven after fulfilling His mission here on earth. We eagerly await the day He returns to establish His eternal kingdom, eliminate sin entirely, and take us home to the place he's been preparing for us.

<small>(Revelation 1:18; Acts 1:9-11; Philippians 3:20; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Hebrews 9:28; John 14:3)</small>
<br />
<br />


## GOD IS MAKING ALL THINGS NEW

We believe that God's plan is to restore and renew all things. Through Jesus' resurrection, He has begun the renewal of creation, and one day He will make all things right. Those who trust in Him will share in His eternal life, dwelling with God in the new heavens and new earth, where He will wipe away every tear, and death will be no more. 

<small>(Philippians 3:20; John 11:26; Revelation 20:11-15; Ephesians 2:8-9; John 14:3; Revelation 21:4)</small>
<br />
<br />


## THE BIBLE IS GOD'S WORD

We believe all Scripture is the inspired Word of God and its authors were moved by the Holy Spirit to write its very words. Therefore, we believe Scripture is true and reliable, and the supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct. 

<small>(John 17:17; Romans 15:4; 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:19-21; Psalm 19:7-11)</small>
<br />
<br />

## How We Approach Beliefs

In essential beliefs, we have UNITY.

We define the 'essential beliefs' as the foundational statements above. 

In non-essential beliefs, we have LIBERTY.

Our leadership has convictions and beliefs in many other areas, and we assume you do too! Jesus came to take away our sin, not our minds. We don't expect everyone at Arbor to believe the same thing about the many expressions of Scripture and faith that make the Church so beautifully diverse. We refuse to whittle down our unity by demanding we all think "alike" in every area. Unity isn't believing the same thing, it's serving the same purpose. And our purpose is Making Disciples... together.
