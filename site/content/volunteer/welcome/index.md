The true first impression of Arbor Church! From the parking lot, to greeting at the door, to serving fresh hot coffee... the Welcome Team exists to create an environment where every individual who walks in feels welcome! As a part of this team you would help make our guests feel at home, add to the caring community, and play a significant role in helping people have a positive experience.
