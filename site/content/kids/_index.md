Arbor Kids is purposely designed to HELP FAMILIES RAISE DISCIPLES. We do this by providing environments where kids have the freedom to be themselves, connect with others, and learn about Jesus. Adult leaders are the heart and soul of how this happens... through relational ministry. They SHOW UP consistently, SHOW CARE relationally, and SHARE GOD'S STORY intentionally. We work hard to create a place where kids feel cared for and where parents know they're safe.

To continue connecting with kids in this season of Covid-19, we are now meeting online through ZOOM. Meeting online allows us to once again safely SHOW UP consistently, SHOW CARE relationally, and SHARE GOD'S STORY intentionally.

Our summer program is called ARBOR ADVENTURES and at this time, we are taking an adventure through Genesis and Exodus where we learn about God, join into exciting worship together, and have a bunch of fun connecting through online games, challenges and sharing!

Join us on <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/5095540648">Zoom</a> or enter our Zoom room number: 5095540648

Parents: if you add your child's name and age number before signing on, we can better place your kids with other kids that are friends or kids closer to their age!
