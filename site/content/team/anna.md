Raised in Big Sky Country, Anna made the Pacific Northwest home a dozen years ago with her childhood sweetheart, Kevin. Together they have succeeded in creating three sons with the most phenomenal eyelashes known to mankind: Riley, Liam, and Brecken.  

Anna's education as an elementary school teacher has given her great insight in creating our kids' program here at Arbor.  We love that God also prepared her for this position with leadership experience in MOPS and women's ministries. But most of all, we love that He gave Anna a heart for serving children, a gentle sense of humor, a work ethic that won't quit and world-class s'more making skills.
