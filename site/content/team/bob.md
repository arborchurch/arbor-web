Bob is, next to Jake, the most frequent teacher at Arbor. We believe this is due to the fact that his red hair gives him an edge over all other speakers. He and his wife, Ruth, have been married for eleven years and have three young children: Avery, Wyatt, and Jack.

Bob's professional experience includes working as a pastor, as a deputy with the King County Sheriff's Office, and even running a handyman business. He currently is the Operations Director at Stronger Families, and serves part time in the Washington Army National Guard. Not surprisingly, his favorite color is camo, followed closely by red, white and blue.
