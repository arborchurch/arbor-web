Jake is a Pacific Northwest native: a flannel, trucks, and country music guy raised in the small town of Eatonville. When he's not fishing, he's hanging out with his wife and kids, hopefully at Disneyland. After the loss of their 3-year-old daughter, Magnolia, Jake has a renewed passion to tell others about Jesus and the heaven their little girl is now playing in. He is grateful for the people of Arbor Church partnering together to share that message.
