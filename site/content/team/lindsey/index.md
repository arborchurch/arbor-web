Lindsey was born and raised in Northern Arizona. She, along with her husband and two kids, made their way to the Bothell area in 2021. Even with the big adjustment to the rainy weather, they have truly found their home. The only compromise being the lack of authentic Mexican food. Which, they can get over.

When Lindsey isn't working she enjoys traveling with her family, finding a new place to eat, cooking up a new recipe or being near the water. She feels immense gratitude at being able to support families and children here at Arbor Church.
