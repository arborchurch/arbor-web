Raised in Big Sky Country, Anna made Seattle home fifteen years ago with her family. She is the mother of three boys who love baseball, snow skiing, and roasting sâ€™mores over the open campfire.

Having a heart for discipleship means she loves seeing lives transformed by the power of Jesus, and is passionate about equipping people to use the gifts God has given them to serve others..
