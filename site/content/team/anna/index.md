Raised in Big Sky Country, Anna made Seattle home a dozen years ago with her childhood sweetheart, Kevin. Together they have created a family that loves to baseball, snow skiing, and roasting s'mores over the open campfire.

Having a heart for discipleship means she loves seeing lives transformed by the power of Jesus, and is passionate about building community through the local church.
