Michael oversees the kiddos here at Arbor, three of whom are his own! He's one of the most authentic, fully-present people you'll ever meet... seriously.  This, combined with his natural creativity, makes the kids' rooms the place to be. It probably comes as no surprise that Michael's background is in the arts including being the frontman for a cover band performing in front of the camera or on stage. In fact he met his wife, Halle at Taproot Theater in Seattle.

Besides the stage, Michael also enjoys traveling, playing guitar, and loving people with food. Feel free to invite yourself over for dinner and a song!
