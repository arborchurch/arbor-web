Bryan is often mistaken for Aquaman, but ironically he can't swim. He grew up in Modesto, California, but thankfully answered the youth ministry call to move northward. His favorite things include: football, food, family, and friends (in that order). 

Bryan and his wife Audra are raising their son, Kade, to love Jesus and the San Francisco 49ers (in that order).
