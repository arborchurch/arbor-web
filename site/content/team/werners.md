Once upon a time, Cara and Jack met on a worship team and fell in love. They decided to permanently make beautiful music together in 2009. Since then, God has increased their "band" by adding to it 4 children: Leroy, Owen, Chance and Harley. 

Their many years of worship experience has blessed our church as we seek to glorify God together. Additionally, beyond sheer musical talent, Jack also serves our church with media and technical art expertise, making the Werner impact at Arbor even stronger.
