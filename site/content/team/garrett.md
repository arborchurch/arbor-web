Born and raised in the PNW, Garrett's a little bit city, a little bit country. A connoisseur of slapstick comedy, great food and a love for adventure, you can find him on the river scaring away the fish as he's slipping, filling his waders with water and laughing too hard to stand back up. 

Experiencing God & spending time with his wife & three kids are his two greatest passions. God is great and His love displayed through the local church can change the world!
