Garrett grew up on the Eastside of Seattle. A city guy with a love for the outdoors who was called out from ten years in the marketplace to full-time vocational ministry. This year marks one decade in ministry and it's been amazing.

Garrett has been married for 14yrs to his wife, Tahnee. They have two daughters as well as a son on the way. They love the outdoors and going on adventures, road tripping around the Pacific Northwest and listening to music. When they're not doing stuff as a family, Garrett enjoys backpacking & fly fishing.
