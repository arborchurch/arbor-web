Jonathan has lived all over the USA, but married a local girl and now calls the Pacific Northwest his home. He and his wife Kelly have been part of many ministries at Arbor and can often be found in the company of their three adorable children. Jonathan loves reading books and riding his bicycle, and is an amateur pianist. He's also a bit of a computer nerd and has a day job writing software. 

(Jonathan still needs a nice picture. In the meantime, he invites you to admire this *magnificent* tree frog.)
