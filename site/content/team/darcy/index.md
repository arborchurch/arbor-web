Darcy grew up in Arbor's backyard and as a teen came to faith in Jesus through Young Life. Her love of outdoor activity led her to meet her husband, Timo, where they both worked for REI. Learning to climb Mount Rainier together was their first adventure; raising three children was the next!  

Darcy shines brightest in worship, prayer, and in the sunshine. Her heart is to help others know the love and grace of Jesus, a beautiful combination with her leadership gifts as an elder.
