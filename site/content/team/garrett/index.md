Garrett is a little bit city, a little bit country, and the only staff member who grew up in Arbor's backyard. A connoisseur of slapstick comedy, great food, and a love for adventure, you can find him on the river scaring away the fisha s he's slipping, filling his waders with water and laughing too hard to stand back up.

Experiencing God & spending time with his wife & three kids are his two greatest passions. Garrett loves adventure, but the best adventure of all is seeing God's love displayed through the local church.
