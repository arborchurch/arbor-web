Garrett happens to be the only staff member who grew up in Arbor's backyard, which gives him superior leverage when it comes to picking great restaurants and the perfect day hike. His superpower is quoting movies from every genre and decade, the more ridiculous and slapstick the better.

Experiencing God & spending time with his wife & three kids are his two greatest passions. Garrett loves adventure, but the best adventure of all is seeing God's love displayed through the local church.
