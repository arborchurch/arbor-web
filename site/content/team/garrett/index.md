Garrett happens to be the only staff member who grew up in Arbor's backyard, which makes him both a great connector of people and connoisseur of local restaurants. Serving in many area ministries has given him the experience and context that is a tremendous asset for our young church. 

Experiencing God & spending time with his wife & three kids are his two greatest passions. Garrett loves adventure, but the best adventure of all is seeing God's love displayed through the local church! It can change the world!
