Katie is a single mama to two wild and wonderful boys, a licensed esthetician, and a lover of all things skin and self-care. She was raised in Bothell as a pastor's kid, which gave her a deep sense of faith and family. In her free time you'll likely find her eating too much Chik-fil-A (if there is such a thing) or enjoying time with family on Whidbey Island -- relaxing by the lake and recharging in nature.
