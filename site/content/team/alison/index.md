You probably could already tell from her tan, but Alison grew up on the sunny Southern California beaches before she and her husband relocated to the slower pace of life found in... Bellevue. Ironic. 28 years and three kids later, things never really slowed down.

The smile lines on her face are brought to you by many years in youth ministry and her two little granddaughters. After experiencing tears in addition to those smiles, Alison's deepest desire now is to help the hurting find the hope and comfort only Jesus can bring.
