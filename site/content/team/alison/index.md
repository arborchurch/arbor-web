You probably could already tell from her tan, but Alison grew up on sunny Southern California beaches before she and her husband relocated in 1990 to the slower pace of life found in... Bellevue. Ironic. 

The smile lines on her face are brought to you by many years in youth ministry, her three adult children, and three little granddaughters. After experiencing her share of tears, Alison's deepest desire now is to help the hurting find the hope and comfort only Jesus can bring.
