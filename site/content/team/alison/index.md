You probably could already tell from her tan, but Alison grew up on the sunny Southern California beaches before "seeing the light" and moving to the PNW (and no, that light was not the sun).

Alison married the boy next door and together they raised three kids to be fully functional adults.., then to their surprise, those adult children moved away! Fortunately, grandchildren are a thing.

Caring for the Arbor community is Alison's ministry dream come true. For a novice writer who spends the bulk of her day wordsmithing, the best she can muster to describe this privilege? INDESCRIBABLE.
