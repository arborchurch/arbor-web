Jan has served our church on the Usher and Prayer Teams from the very beginning, in addition to leading groups and serving as a group mentor. Over time, as the Prayer Team Lead, Jan effectively expanded and deepened the prayer ministry. Her spiritual leadership and influence have impacted Arbor on every level as a result. She lives in Seattle, near her son, daughter in law, and three beloved grandsons.
