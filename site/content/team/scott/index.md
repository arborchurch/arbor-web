Scott volunteers on the teaching team here at Arbor. Not only is he a great communicator, he can pretty much do everything else... and has! From backpacking, to guiding white-water rafting trips, Scott loves to be outdoors. He's a former youth pastor, camp director, and the current principal at Spiritridge Elementary in Bellevue. 

More than all of that, he is a dedicated father of three, who loves Jesus with all his heart.
