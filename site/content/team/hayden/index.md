Home for Hayden has always been the Pacific Northwest. It may sound cliche, but growing up in Vancouver, Washington means he naturally loves our cold rain, especially if there's a hot coffee in his hand. When it comes time to thaw out, he and his wife, Sara, have a passion for traveling to new cultures where they love to try all the regional foods.

In addition to leading worship, and sarcasm, Hayden is also supporting our communication platforms with graphic and visual design.
