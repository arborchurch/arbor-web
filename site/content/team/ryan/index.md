Ryan was born and raised in Chicago, so he's used to summer being the only season where you see the sun. This makes the Pacific Northwest a perfect fit for him. On grayer days, his life is brightened up significantly by his wife, Kerry (who is a Woodinville native), and their three kids -- Ethan, Miles, and Eleanor.

Ryan finds his greatest joy in helping others discover their purpose in life and a place to belong and is convinced those things are most fully found in a relationship with Jesus and with the people of God.
