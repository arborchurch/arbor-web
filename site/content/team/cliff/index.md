You might not be able to tell by just looking at him, but Cliff was born to missionary parents in Nigeria, Africa. One of 8 siblings he has 4 children himself and 15 grandchildren. Cliff's parents have 46 grandchildren, 23 of whom are adopted. That perspective allows Cliff and his wife Caryn to delight in the grace and love God demonstrates to His children by adopting them. 

Cliff has a passion to see broken people experience firsthand God's amazing grace, and restoration. He truly believes that no matter what has happened to you, "God's not done with you yet!"
