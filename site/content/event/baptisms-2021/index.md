We are starting our Summer this year with a splash, or maybe just a dunk! On June 27th, we will celebrate baptisms with those who have made the amazing decision to follow Jesus and want the whole church to know! We believe baptism is an outward expression of an inward commitment that Jesus Himself invites us to participate in. 

If you've never been baptized are are interested, or you have questions, please fill out this [form](https://arborchurch.churchcenter.com/people/forms/261521) and Bryan will reach out to you!
