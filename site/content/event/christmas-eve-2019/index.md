Before we celebrate the joy of Easter morning, we acknowledge the sorrow of the cross. Rescuing us from the grip of sin was not without pain. This unique worship service provides space for us to remember Jesus' sacrifice and to express our gratitude. Due to the somber nature of the evening, childcare is offered for those under 10 years old.
