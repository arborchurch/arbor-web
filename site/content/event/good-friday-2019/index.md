Before we rush to celebrate the joy of Easter morning, we want to pause on Good Friday to reflect on the sacrifice Jesus made on the cross.  A combination of visual images, music, and scripture create space for contemplative worship. Due to the more intense nature of the evening, we provide childcare for kids under 4th grade.
