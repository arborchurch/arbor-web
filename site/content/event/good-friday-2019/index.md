Studying the words of God helps us know the heart of Jesus, drawing us closer to Him and closer to each other in the process. We are currently working through the book of 1 Peter. After watching a video teaching about the passage, we break into small groups for discussion and prayer. Daily homework is encouraged in the workbook ($20). Women of all ages are welcomed. Childcare is available for those with small children. 

For more information, reach out to groups@arborchurch.com.
