Let's do a ballgame TOGETHER! On July 26th, we are heading to the ballpark to watch the Mariners take on the Detroit Tigers. We'd love for you to come with us! We've got a whole section reserved for our Arbor fan club. The tickets are going for $15 each. So, whether you are a faithful follower, band wagon fanatic or fair weather fan, we want to spend the night connecting with you. When you make your ticket purchase, please provide the mailing address you would like the tickets mailed to the week of July 15.
