Maybe the shift in season has stirred the grief you carry; autumn has a way of doing that with its rich sensory display and its step toward nostalgic family holidays. Is this the year for some grief work, perhaps?\
\
Arbor is hosting **GRIEFSHARE** on Wednesday evenings beginning October 5th, and you are warmly invited to attend regardless of church affiliation. Running 13 weeks, this session deliberately bookends the holiday season so as to provide optimal bereavement support.\
\
GriefShare is a nationally respected, faith-based program that relies on a threefold approach to healing: counsel from professional therapists via video, daily bite-sized homework, and warmly supportive community found in the group. \
