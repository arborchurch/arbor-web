[GriefShare](https://www.griefshare.org/) is a nationally respected program for people coping with the pain and challenge of grief. Having a supportive and empathetic community during a season of grief can significantly cushion a broken heart. Our leaders, Dave and Jill Swenson, have experienced their own share of loss and are able to come alongside others with wisdom and compassion.  The group will spend thirteen weeks following a video and discussion format, supplemented by homework in an individual workbook ($15). 

While our losses may be unique, they don't need to isolate us. We look forward to seeing God work through the encouragement of community at such a time as this. For more information, reach out to <groups@arborchurch.com>.
