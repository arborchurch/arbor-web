Before the sun rises, there's a group of guys gathering over coffee and breakfast to study scripture. Led by Phil Pierson and Jonathan McPherson, men of all ages are welcome to drop by for time in the Word and hearty conversation. Currently we're walking through the gospel of John. 

For more information, reach out to groups@arborchurch.com.
