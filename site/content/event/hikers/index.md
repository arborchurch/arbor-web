It stands to reason that with a church named Arbor there would be some hikers in our crowd! They've not only found each other to hit the trails with, they want to invite YOU to join them! From Lake Serene to Wallace Falls to Annette Lake and beyond, the Arbor Hikers are heading out for adventure a couple Saturdays a month this year. 

Connect with Annette at <annettesternberg10@gmail.com> for more info. See you on the trail!
