On the darkest night of the year, the winter solstice, churches open their doors to those seeking time near the Light. Christmas is often a lonely time of year, a time we feel homesick for people and places we love.

If the glimmer and shimmer of tinsel doesn't seem to match the blue of your heart, we want to invite you over to Arbor on Tuesday, December 21 at 7pm. Here you'll find a peaceful worship space, low-key and candlelit.. with just the right amount of scripture, song, and solace to make your spirit lighter.

We welcome you to invite your friend who is grieving... the one who is heavyhearted... the one coping with hard news. Invite the lonely and the one in need of comfort. Tell them to come as they are.
