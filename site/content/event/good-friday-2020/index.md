Before we celebrate the joy of Easter morning, we acknowledge the sorrow of the cross. Rescuing us from the grip of sin was not without pain. This unique worship service provides space for us to remember Jesus' sacrifice and to express our gratitude. Join us on YouTube or our Arbor Church Facebook page at 8pm... before you jump online, make sure to bring your communion supplies and light a candle.
