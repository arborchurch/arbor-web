title: "Group Leader Training"
---

**FALL GROUPS** are around the corner, but before they begin, we want to gather the leaders for bagels and training. Let's get on the same page, even if you've been a leader for many trimesters before! And if you are feeling the Lord nudge you toward leading your OWN group, buy all means let us know and we'll get you looped in!

Leaders, come over to the "Soundline Suite" after service on the 18th... it's the office suite at the top of the stairs. You'll be out in less than an hour! Ping Alison with any Q's to A.
