Summers are a great time for students to get away, connect with God  and connect with others in middle school and high school. This year we'll be partnering with [Imprint Church](https://imprintchurch.org/) for a three day camp at [Miracle Ranch](https://cristacamps.com/our-camps/miracle-ranch/) in Port Orchard. There will be paint-balling, horseback riding, a color war, campfires, teaching from God's Word and a chance to dialogue about what was said afterwards.  If you have a student in your house, or you are a student... this is a life changing weekend that you don't wanna miss. You can sign up at <http://imprintchurch.org/summercamp>.
