This summer we are so excited to actually see you all again! In addition to Tent Church every Sunday, we are going to be having BONFIRES. This will be a time where we can talk around the fire, eat s'mores, and enjoy some much needed fellowship. We understand taking the whole family out during COVID can be challenging, so we've planned Bonfires for guys and ladies on different dates, which hopefully covers babysitting issues (single parents, please contact us if you need help with babysitting costs). 

We ask that everyone who attends wears a face mask and respects the safety of those around.
