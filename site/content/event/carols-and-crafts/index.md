Carols & Crafts is a time to share the joy of Christmas with others. Having friends of all ages can lift the spirits of seniors, so infants, children, teens, and adults are invited to spend the evening with the Sisters of St Joseph. Crafts, caroling, and conversation will create a significant time as we step away from the rush of the season and seek to bless these nuns. 

Space allows for 20 cars on site, and 30 humans max. To sign up, email <info@arborchurch.com>.
