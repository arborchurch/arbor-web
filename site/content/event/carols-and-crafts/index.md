Carols & Crafts is a time to share the joy of Christmas with others. Having friends of all ages can lift the spirits of seniors, so infants, children, teens, and adults are invited to spend the morning with the Sisters of St Joseph. Crafts, caroling, and conversation will create a significant time as we step away from the rush of the season and seek to bless these nuns. 

We will carpool to St Mary's on the Lake from the Enatai Park and Ride, beginning at 9:45am. This event costs nothing but your time and attention. To sign up, email <info@arborchurch.com>.
