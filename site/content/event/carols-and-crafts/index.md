This summer we are so excited to be able to actually see you all again! As well as Tent Church every Sunday, we are going to be having Bonfires. This will be a time where we can talk around the fire, eat s'mores, and enjoy some much needed fellowship. We understand taking the whole family out during COVID can be challenging, so we are going to have Bonfires for guys and ladies on different dates. 

We ask that everyone who attends wears a face mask and respects the safety of those around.
