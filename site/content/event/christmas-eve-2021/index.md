We are ready as we're going to be to celebrate Jesus' birth with you next on the 24th! Tell your kids they can hold a candle and tell the grandparents we'll have hot cocoa! There's something for everyone and we'll keep everyone as safe as possible with masks, pristine air flow, and roomy seating.

Hope to see you at either our 2pm or 4pm service times! O come, all ye faithful!
