Since our whole faith hinges on the resurrection of Jesus, no other event means more to us than Easter! Because He rose from the dead, we are free from sin and hold onto the hope of heaven... an eternity of life, love, wholeness, peace and joy! 

Please come and join us for the monumental celebration of Easter morning! It wouldn't be the same without you.
