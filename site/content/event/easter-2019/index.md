Many churches have "membership," but we have our own take on that. The Discover Class is your passport to knowing ALL THINGS ARBOR: our history, our beliefs, and our goals. It's also the trailhead for connection and how to get started around here. 

Over a four week cycle that is offered every month, we'll be going on a journey together to explore the BACKROADS of our church. This class is designed to be an exploration of who we are, where we've been and where we hope to go.

Walk-ins welcome to our 11am class. For more information, contact Anna@arborchurch.com
