The outward expression of an inward faith is **BAPTISM**. It is a sacrament, or holy mystery, that believers participate in. Jesus Himself was baptized, and throughout scripture we see multiple examples of baptism that immediately follows a declaration of faith. In baptism, our old sinful/flesh life is washed away and we are raised to new life in Christ. Being baptized is an act of obedience and surrender, but it's also a moment of celebration! We become part of a faith family!\
