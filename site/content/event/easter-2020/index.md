Easter Sunday is a beautiful time to gather as we experience the joy of the resurrection together!  Join us as we praise God for the promise of eternity found in the hope of an empty tomb. Families are invited to worship together, or kids (birth through 5th grade) can enjoy the morning with ArborKids.
