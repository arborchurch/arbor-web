[Celebrate Recovery](https://www.celebraterecovery.com/) is a faith-based, 12 step recovery program for those struggling with hurt, pain or addiction of any kind. It's a safe place to find community and freedom from the issues that are controlling our lives. 

Come for BBQ at 6pm before large group starts at 7pm. From there we'll break into small groups and wrap up by 9pm. Childcare is offered, too! We'll see you Monday.
