Under, above, around, and through everything here at Arbor is a covering of prayer. Our Prayer Team intercedes on behalf of the church family to bring the healing power of Jesus to hurting hearts. They pray together prior to Sunday services, as prayer partners during service, and privately pray for requests throughout the week. If you have a heart for prayer we covet your participation on this mission-critical team.
