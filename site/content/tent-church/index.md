 We're so excited to see you at our outdoor services starting on July 12th. We have become creative problem solvers and event planners to ensure that we not only meet the state requirements to reopen the church while ensuring health & safety, but to create a fun and joy-filled experience that we can all look forward to. 

That said, here are a few common questions that have come up. If we didn't answer your question here, please reach out to us!  

## WHAT EXACTLY IS TENT CHURCH?

Tent Church is our in-person gather for Sunday worship services, which for the meantime is outside... under large canopy tents. The tents we're referring to are large, commercial-grade tents which allow for people to sit, socially distanced, while watching our pre-recorded sermon. 

## WHERE IS TENT CHURCH?

Tent Church will take place on Sundays at 9:30am starting July 12th. Tent Church is at a different location than our regular location. Here is the address:

Snohomish, WA 98296</a>

## CAN I BRING MY KIDS WITH ME TO CHURCH?

Yes! Families of all shapes and sizes are welcome. We will have seating in place to group people from the same household together, six feet apart from others. Please note that there will not be kids ministry at Tent Church, but you can participate in kids ministry online [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/5095540648).

## HOW DO I VOLUNTEER AT TENT CHURCH?

We thought you'd never ask :) Send an email to <kelly@willowandoaksolutions.com> and she'll give you the low-down on volunteer opportunities and plug you in.

## WHY AREN'T WE MEETING INSIDE THE CHURCH?

We've opted for outdoor services for a few reasons: First, by hosting Tent Church outside we can accomodate more people than if we were indoors. Secondly, by meeting outdoors, we obviously have better ventilation and reduce our exposure to high touch surfaces (like doorknobs and elevator buttons, for example)

## WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CHURCHES TO REOPEN?

You can review Washington State's recently updated guidelines for churches [HERE](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/COVID19Phase1and2ReligiousAndFaithBasedGuidance.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery).

## DO I HAVE TO WEAR A MASK?

Yes! It's a requirement for everyone in the state of Washington right now. You can read more about the mask requirements and exemptions [here](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/ClothFacemasks.pdf). Masks are required for the duration that you are at the service, including worship and during the service and afterward.

## CAN I STILL WATCH ONLINE FROM HOME ON SUNDAYS?

Definitely! We're committed to providing ongoing online sunday worship services indefinitely. 

## DO I NEED TO MAKE A RESERVATION TO ATTEND TENT CHURCH?

Nope! We're trying to make attending church as easy and seamless as possible for anyone who wants to attend. 

## WHAT WILL WORSHIP BE LIKE AT TENT CHURCH?

Because we're committed to providing a great experience for our online viewers as well, we will continue to pre-record our messages, as well as the worship portion. We will show our messages, including the worship portion, at tent church on a large screen. Imagine a socially-distant, outdoor viewing party. 

## WHAT'S THE BATHROOM AND HANDWASHING SITUATION?

We will have two Honey Buckets onsite as well as a hand washing station with running water. We have taken measures to ensure our handwashing stations meet the criteria as stated in the requirements. 

## WILL THERE BE COFFEE AND SNACKS?

Unfortunately for some, No. We want to eliminate as many risks to exposure as possible so we ask that you bring your own coffee and snacks to Tent Church.

## WHAT IS ARBOR DOING TO ENSURE OUR SAFETY AT TENT CHURCH?

While of course we can't guarantee anything, we've spent months and exhausted our resources to ensure that we provide the safest possible experience for our visitors, volunteers, and staff. We wouldn't go to the effort to meet in person if we didn't feel that this was safe. We humbly ask that everyone respects the requirements that we must comply with as provided by the State of Washington. Specifically, here are some safety measures that you can expect at Tent Church:

1. Providing masks and gloves for anyone who needs one
2. Social DIstance Seating Arrangements
3. Handwashing Stations
4. Hand Sanitizer placed throughout the grounds
5. No shared pens or stationary 
6. No communal food/drinks
7. Staff and volunteer training
8. Disinfecting chairs, tables, handwashing stations (and more) on a regular schedule prior to and after services
9. Screening of staff and volunteers prior to service. 
10. Keeping a guestbook in case of outbreak for contact tracing (this is optional and you're not required to provide your name if you don't want to)

THANK YOU for your patience, understanding, compassion, and prayers as we work through the details of what meeting together looks like. Ultimately our shared common goal is always to help people to find and follow Jesus. Tent Church is just one way that we can do this during a pandemic. We look forward to seeing you on July 12th!
