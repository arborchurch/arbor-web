## How many of us can come on Sunday? 

We abide by local guidelines for our capacity limits, which at this time are back to 100%!


## Can I bring my family with me?

Please do! We have space in our kid classes for birth through elementary, or they are more than welcome to come to the sanctuary with their grownups!

## What if I'm not comfortable coming to a service yet?

That is okay! We know everyone has a different level of comfort. This step of the journey may not be the best timing for you, but trust that soon you'll find the step that's right for your family. We will continue to livestream our services indefinitely on Facebook, Youtube, and the Online Campus so you won't miss a thing.

## What about online church?

Whether you are out of the zip code, unwell, or snowed in, our [Online Campus](https://arborchurch.online.church/) will be open every week at 9am.  Our Prayer Team is available to pray with you at the Online Campus as well, or can be emailed 24/7 at <prayer@arborchurch.com>. 

## What if I'm not feeling well?

If you are unwell, or if a family member is unwell, we welcome you to worship with us online instead of on-campus. Your RSVP confirmation email contains easy instructions for canceling... thank you for notifying us about your absence so we can make room for the next person on the waitlist.

## What can I expect?

All the things you’re used to in our weekend service will still be there -- the presence of your church family, a great message with personal application, and worship! But, in order to ensure that everyone is safe and comfortable, we ask that unvaccinated people stay masked for the time being. This too shall pass! We look at slight discomforts like masks as a way to protect and bless those who are at risk.

## How are the facilities prepared for worship services?

- Hand sanitizer stations will be available at entries and exits as well as throughout the building.
- Our services and guest interactions will be intentionally touch-free (e.g., no hugs or hand-shakes for now, we will not pass an offering bucket, etc…).
- Air conditioners will be turned on during service and doors are kept open.

## What about masks?

At this stage, unvaxxed people are asked to wear masks at all times in the building.  


## Will the church be open for other activities during the week?

Currently, Arbor is open for staff office time, Food Bank prep & distribution, Student Ministry on Thursday evenings, and various small groups.
