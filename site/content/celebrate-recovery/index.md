<h2 class="tight-header">Monday Nights</h2> from 6:15-9pm at Arbor

[Celebrate Recovery](https://www.celebraterecovery.com/) is a faith-based, 12 step program for those struggling with hurt, pain or addiction of any kind. It's a safe place to find community and freedom from the issues that are controlling our lives. Our hope is to provide the atmosphere of support and encouragement needed in recovery.

Come for a barbeque dinner at 6:15pm before large group starts at 7pm. After a time of music and teaching, we'll break into groups and wrap up by 9pm. Childcare is offered for those who need it. We'll see you Monday!
