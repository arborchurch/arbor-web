[Celebrate Recovery](https://www.celebraterecovery.com/) is staying connected via the ArborCR Facebook page. Please friend us or follow us for devotions, lessons, and live worship. We also meet every Monday evening at 8pm via Zoom for open share groups... one meeting for men and one for women. Newly implemented guidelines from Celebrate Recovery will be followed to ensure a safe online sharing environment.

For more information, reach out to <cr@arborchurch.com>.
