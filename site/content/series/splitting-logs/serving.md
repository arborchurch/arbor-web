"He who splits logs is endangered by them.  If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge, he must use more strength, but wisdom helps one to succeed." -- Ecclesiastes 10:9b-10 (ESV). This week we start a new sermon series based on this verse. For starters we're talking about splitting the log of *serving*, and Jake shares some wisdom from Scripture (and his father) on focus and burnout.
