If you were in the church scene in the 90's, you can't have missed the **WWJD** bracelets everyone was wearing -- *What
Would Jesus Do?*. In our new series, we're turning that question on its head: What would Jesus *undo*? And this week,
it's that spiritual *meh*, the "enough Jesus to get me by" doldrums we've all walked through at one time or another.
Jake shares one simple thing you can do to undo spiritual indifference in your life.
