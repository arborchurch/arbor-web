*Elijah was afraid, so he got up and fled for his life to Beer Sheba in Judah. He left his servant there, while he went a day's journey into the wilderness. He went and sat down under a shrub and asked the Lord to take his life.*

-- 1 Kings 19:3-4

Ryan continues our series on the spiritual discipline of *solitude* with a framework based on Elijah's time in the
wilderness after a threat on his life. How can we quiet the roiling thoughts and emotions that arise when we try to be
alone with God?
