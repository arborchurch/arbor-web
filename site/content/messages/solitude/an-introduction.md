*Then Jesus got up early in the morning when it was still very dark, departed, and went out to a deserted place, and there he spent time in prayer.*

-- Mark 1:35

Following our series on fasting, this week we embark upon a new series on the spiritual discipline of *solitude*. Ryan
defines *solitude* and *silence* and their role in the Christian life.
