We’re kicking off a brand new summer series: The Light We Walk In. Over the coming months, we’ll journey slowly and reflectively through the letter of 1 John, allowing its ancient pastoral wisdom to not only inform us, but to form us. In this opening message, Pastor Ryan invites us to return to the heart of our faith — life with God, shared together — as we begin this transformative walk through John's letter.
