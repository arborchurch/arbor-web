> Arbor is ... a community that **gathers** together -- following Jesus, growing in generosity, and going in love.

As the fall begins and many of us return to more regular rhythms of life, Ryan opens our new series _Arbor Is..._. Each
week we'll unpack another part of our identity together, and this week we look inward, towards our role as a community
that *gathers together.*
