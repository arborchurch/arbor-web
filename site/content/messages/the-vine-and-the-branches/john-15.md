> I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me -- and I in him -- bears much fruit, because apart from me you can accomplish nothing.

-- John 15

As January begins, Alison exhorts us to remain rooted in the Vine and gives us practical ways to connect in the New Year. After all, without the life given by the Vine, all us branches are just ... sticks.
