From Hebrews 5, Scott shows us how to grow spiritually by following the example
of Jesus, the great High Priest. Spiritual growth isn't about strength,
knowledge, or having all the answers ... it's about weakness, prayer, a
willingness to endure discomfort, and ultimately our relationship with God.
