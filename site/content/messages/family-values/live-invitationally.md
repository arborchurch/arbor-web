Our new series *Family Values* is all about how we, as a church and as
individuals, achieve our mission of helping people find and follow Jesus: we
**live** invitationally, **engage** consistently, **grow** spiritually, **give**
generously, and **serve** sacrificially. Today, Cliff teaches from Luke 12 on
the subject of *Living Invitationally* and the value of truly being ready for
Jesus. How does it change our schedule, priorities, relationships, and lives?
