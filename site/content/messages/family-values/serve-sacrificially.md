1 Peter 4:10 -- *As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as
good stewards of God's varied grace...*  

From this passage (and from a variety of As Seen On TV products), Bryan closes
our Family Values series with a message on what it means to **Serve
Sacrifically**. How are you using your gift?
