Fasting is just for super-spiritual people and crazy prophets ... or maybe something they did in the Bible that we don't do any more ... right? And if fasting *is* for us -- do we *have* to? In today's message Jake looks at Jesus' teaching on fasting in the Sermon on the Mount and answers all these questions, laying out the *what*, *how*, and *why* of fasting.
