Judge not, lest you be judged! It's one of the few Bible verses that almost everyone seems to know, and many take it to
mean "just don't judge anyone at all, ever". This isn't actually what the Bible says, however, and Jake walks us through
Jesus and Paul's teachings on the *why*, *who*, and *how* of judging.
