> The angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, a descendant of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary. The angel came to her and said, "Greetings, favored one, the Lord is with you!"

-- Luke 1

Advent hope is born when ordinary people make room, in the dark, for the king who has already stepped in.
