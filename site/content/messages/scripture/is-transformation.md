*Blessed is the one... whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night.*

-- Psalm 1:2

Ryan concludes our series on Scripture by answering the question, 'What is Scripture?' In this sermon, we explore how we can find delight in Scripture and how God uses it to transform us.
