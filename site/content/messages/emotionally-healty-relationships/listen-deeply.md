We continue our series _Emotionally Healthy Relationships_ this week, with a message about listening deeply to those around us. Listening is more than just being quiet, and Ryan helps us understand what it means to listen deeply by following Jesus' example and listening _incarnationally_. (What does that mean? _Listen and find out._)
