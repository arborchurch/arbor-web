Our new series _Emotionally Healthy Relationships_ explores the idea that _spiritual maturity and emotional health are inseparable_. This week, Ryan talks about the innately human tendency to read minds and assume we know what other people are thinking and why they act as they do, and offers practical steps for challenging the assumptions we make about each other that so often lead to conflict.
