> This was according to the eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and confident access to God by way of Christ’s faithfulness. For this reason I ask you not to lose heart because of what I am suffering for you, which is your glory.

-- Ephesians 3

Even as we suffer, even as we wonder why, and even as we doubt there being any good left, we can trust God's triumph in Christ.
