> For he is our peace, the one who made both groups into one and who destroyed the middle wall of partition, the hostility, when he nullified in his flesh the law of commandments in decrees. He did this to create in himself one new man out of two, thus making peace, and to reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by which the hostility has been killed.

-- Ephesians 2

We've been rescued not just _from_ sin but _into_ a new reality. This week, Ryan teaches on the unity we're called to in Christ.
