*Then some Pharisees came, and to test him they asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"*

-- Mark 10:2

The Pharisees tried to trick Jesus into taking sides on the topic of divorce. It was a contentious matter in Jesus' time, and, in the two thousand years since, it hasn't gotten any easier. Today, Scott tackles this tough subject with love and humility.
