If you grew up in the church, the word "Christian" might mean something very simple to you -- praying the Sinner's Prayer, believing certain things, trying to be good most of the time, going to church now and again. But the word "Christian" is not used very often in Scripture, and never by Jesus; he didn't have Christians. He had _disciples_. Today, from Mark 1-3, Ryan helps us understand what discipleship meant to Jesus.
