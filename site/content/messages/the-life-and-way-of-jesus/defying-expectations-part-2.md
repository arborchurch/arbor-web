We opened the _Life and Way of Jesus_ series with a message about Jesus's tendency to [defy everyone's expectations](https://www.arborchurch.com/messages/the-life-and-way-of-jesus/defying-expectations/). Today, Jesus is back at it... healing a blind man with some spit (and only ... halfway healing him at first?!), saying _Get behind me, Satan!_ to the man who had just made the most famous confession of faith in history, and telling everyone _not_ to tell anyone who he really is.
