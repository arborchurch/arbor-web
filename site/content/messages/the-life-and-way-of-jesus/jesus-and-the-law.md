*Now when Jesus had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable. He said to them, "Are you so foolish? Don't you understand that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him? [...] What comes out of a person defiles him."* -- Mark 7:17-20

From Mark 7, Alison speaks about Jesus' confrontation with the Pharisees, the Law, legalism, our hearts, our insides,
our outsides, and (of course) Taylor Swift.
