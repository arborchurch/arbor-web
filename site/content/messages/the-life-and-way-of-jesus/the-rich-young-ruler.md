*"Now as Jesus was starting out on his way, someone ran up to him, fell on his knees, and said, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

From Mark 10:17-31, the story of a man who seemed like he had absolutely everything he needed to enter the Kingdom of
God -- humility, obedience, religious piety, and sure proof of God's blessing in his abundant wealth. This week, Ryan
helps us understand what this question meant for first-century Jews ... and what questions we can ask about our
relationship to money today.
