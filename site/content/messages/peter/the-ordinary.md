This week we start a new 10 week (yes, 10 week!) series on Peter. He was just an ordinary man who lived what was in most
ways an ordinary life, a big-hearted fisherman who Jesus loved. Our aim in this series is not just to learn about Peter
himself but to learn more about Jesus as we see him through Peter's eyes.
