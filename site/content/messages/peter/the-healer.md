Peter didn't have money, but he did have a God-given gift of healing. After God healed a lame man through Peter, people would place the sick where Peter's shadow would fall on them, believing that even this would heal their loved ones. Today, we explore the theology of God's gift of healing in Peter's day ... and ours.
