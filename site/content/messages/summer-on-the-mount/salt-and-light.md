*"You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet."* -- Matthew 5:13. Pastor Ryan unpacks the rich meaning of this familiar passage: what *salt* and *light* tell us about who we are, how Jesus sees us, and our role in the world in which we temporarily reside.
