*"Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is the log in your own eye"?* -- Matthew 7:1-4. Today, Ryan closes our *Summer on the Mount* series with an honest look at what it takes to reform our naturally judgmental hearts.
