*Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.* -- Matthew 5:9. Ryan opens our new **Summer on the Mount** series with a message on peacemaking in our divisive and polarized times -- not peacekilling, or even peacekeeping, but literally doing the hard work of *making peace*, as believers and as a church body.
