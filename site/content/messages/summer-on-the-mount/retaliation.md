*"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.* -- Matthew 5:38--39. This is one of the most challenging teachings Jesus gives us in the Sermon on the Mount. Did the One who flipped tables in the temple really suggest that we should lie down and let others walk all over us? What's Jesus calling us to do in this passage? Ryan puts this passage in context and shows us how voluntary acts of love can break the vicious cycle of revenge.
