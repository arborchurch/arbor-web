*I appeal to Euodia and to Syntyche to agree in the Lord ... Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I say, rejoice! Let everyone see your gentleness.* -- Philippians 4. Today, we look at a conflict that's often passed over when we read this book, and how Paul admonishes us to shape our response. Will conflict cause us to run away from resilient joy -- or will we become more deeply rooted in it?
