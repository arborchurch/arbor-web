*Nevertheless, you did well to share with me in my trouble ...And my God will supply your every need according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.* -- Philippians 4. Ryan closes our **Resilient Joy** series at the end of Philippians, which --  as it turns out -- is really just an extremely loquacious thank-you letter for the generosity of the church at Philippi, and shares 7 reasons that *giving is good.*
