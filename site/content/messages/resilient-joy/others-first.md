*Each of you should be concerned not only about your own interests, but about the interests of others as well. You should have the same attitude toward one another that Christ Jesus had...* -- Philippians 2. Today, Ryan teaches through the first part of Philippians 2 and about the resilient joy that can be found in humility, or, as C.S. Lewis put it: not thinking less of yourself, but thinking about yourself less.
