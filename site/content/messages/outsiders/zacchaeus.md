In our new sermon series, we're focusing outward rather than inward, not at ourselves but at those Jesus has called us to serve and reach. Zacchaeus was unquestionably an *outsider*--a short, unethical man despised even among his own people. Bob walks us through the short story of Zacchaeus's encounter with Jesus and explains the 6 thing Jesus did to invite him in.
