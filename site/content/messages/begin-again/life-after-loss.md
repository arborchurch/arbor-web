This week, we embark upon a new series, *Begin Again*, and Jake teaches from the story lovingly painted on hundreds of church nursery walls but somehow regularly passed over by grown-ups: Noah's Ark. Everyone knows the story of how the world ended, but less well know is what came after -- how Noah started again.
