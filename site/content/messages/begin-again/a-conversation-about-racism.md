In light of George Floyd's death and the nationwide protests it has ignited, Scott Hetherington pivots this Sunday to address the topic on everyone's minds. He speaks from personal experience as a man with Black mentors and a servant on a diversity and equity committee, and leads us in a difficult conversation about the Bible, the Church, racism, and each one of us.
