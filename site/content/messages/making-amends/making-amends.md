*Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift...* -- Matthew 5:23-24. In today's special message Jonathan Wolfgang challenges us to actually go out and do what Jesus said.
