Today, Jesus fails to meet ... everyone's expectations. He rides on a colt instead of a horse. Then he gets really emotional about Jerusalem. And finally, he gets *really mad*.

Teaching elder Scott Hetherington shows us, through the story of Palm Sunday, how our expectations of Jesus cause Him to weep over our blindness to Him as our Savior.
