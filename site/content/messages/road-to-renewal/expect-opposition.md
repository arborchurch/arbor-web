If you're seeking the renewal God has called you to, well, you can expect that it isn't going to be easy; you'll face opposition from your enemies, your colleagues, and even yourself. Ryan continues our series _The Road to Renewal_ with a message from Nehemiah explaining what to do when this opposition mounts.
