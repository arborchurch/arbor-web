*And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" Then I said, "Here I am! Send me."* -- Isaiah 6:8. It's easy enough to say these words, but when it comes down to it, most of us have a lot of excuses and qualifications around this prayer. Guest speaker Pat Swanson breaks these down and shows us what it means to pray this prayer and mean it.
