How often do we think about heaven? Typically we don't, unless we receive a difficult diagnosis or lose someone we love, the afterlife is usually an afterthought. The writer of Hebrews says that this world is not our home... heaven is our home. How would our lives be different today if we really believed we were going home tomorrow?
