Thomas is a disciple so famous for his unbelief that he's often referred to as *Doubting Thomas*, but his faith wasn't always weak. Jake paints a more complete picture of Thomas from the handful of other accounts of him in the Gospels, revealing a man who was also courageous, and from whom we can learn a lot about true discipleship.
