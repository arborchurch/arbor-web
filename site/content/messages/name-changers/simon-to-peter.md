*Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas" (which means Peter.)* -- John 1:42. But Simon's name change wasn't so simple; like ours, his story is messy, full of ups and downs and slips back to his old identity, ready to defend Jesus to the death one day and denying him the next. Scott outlines the four basic phases he went through (and we go through) as Jesus defines who we are. Where are you?
