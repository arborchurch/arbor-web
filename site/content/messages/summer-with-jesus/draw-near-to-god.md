Special guest and longtime friend of Arbor Mike North delivers today's message. Our mission at Arbor is to help the hurting... and to do that we must first address our own hurts, habits, and hangups. Mike challenges us to examine ourselves honestly and with humility, and to draw near to God for help and healing.
