It's a very special Sunday at Arbor: today we celebrate with families who are dedicating their children. Michael, our Children's Director, gives a message from Matthew 19. Jesus said, *"let the little children come to me ... for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."* What did He mean? Can we see and love people the way Jesus sees and loves people?
