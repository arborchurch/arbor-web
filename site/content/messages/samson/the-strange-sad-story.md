This Father's Day, Mike Howerton brings us the story of Samson, one of the Old Testament's tragic heroes -- a man devoted to God but mastered by his desires, and a man who could have benefited from some coaching. Mike shares some thoughts on who and what we allow to master us, and the everyday mantras that keep a life in alignment with God.
