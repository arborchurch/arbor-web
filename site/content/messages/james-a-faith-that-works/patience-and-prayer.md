_Is anyone among you suffering? He should pray. Is anyone in good spirits? He should sing praises. Is anyone among you ill? He should summon the elders of the church, and they should pray for him and anoint him with olive oil in the name of the Lord._ Ryan closes our series on James with a message drawn from the last verses of Chapter 5, wherein James shows us how to have patience in suffering through prayer.
