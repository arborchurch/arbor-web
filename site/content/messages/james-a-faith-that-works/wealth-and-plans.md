_Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that town and spend a year there and do business and make a profit." You do not know about tomorrow. What is your life like?_ - James 4. Today, Scott walks us through James' harsh words for wealthy oppressors, and shows us what it means to honor God with our wealth and our plans.
