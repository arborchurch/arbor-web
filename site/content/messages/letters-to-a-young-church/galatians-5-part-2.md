*...Do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. * -- Galatians 5:13b.
Today, Bryan looks at our freedom in Christ from another perspective. Along the way: shoulder demons, shoulder angels,
logs, specks, spiritual fruit, and a man named [John Baker](https://www.celebraterecovery.co.uk/pastor-john-bakers-testimony/). How will you use your freedom?
