Thessalonians was a letter of encouragement, but Galatians is a little more confrontational. The early church, barely a few years after Jesus founded it, had already begun to suffer a division as legalism and tradition took the place of grace and freedom. Scott digs into the story of the Galatian church and shows us why this story sounds so familiar. (Plus, he says the word *circumcision* a lot.)
