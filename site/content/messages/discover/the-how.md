In the first two weeks, we covered *what* our purpose is and *why* we're here. Now it's time for the nuts and bolts: *how*, exactly, do we go about accomplishing our purpose? What's our strategy? Special guest appearances from people behind the scenes at Arbor, including the leader of our Groups ministry and someone who's witnessed firsthand what God's been doing through our care team.
