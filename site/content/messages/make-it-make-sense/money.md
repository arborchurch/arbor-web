> Remove falsehood and lies far from me; do not give me poverty or riches, feed me with my allotted portion of bread.

-- Proverbs 30:18

Money isn't a popular topic in the church, but it's popular in Proverbs; a huge number of verses in this book of wisdom
have to do with money. This week, Ryan helps us make sense of them by focusing on a prayer for financial wisdom and
peace found in Proverbs 30.
