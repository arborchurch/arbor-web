> Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
> and do not rely on your own understanding.

-- Proverbs 3:5

Guest speaker Garrett Shelp wraps our series on wisdom with a message about how our need for certainty and control can
lead us astray, and what it takes to release these things so we can lead a life of wisdom.
