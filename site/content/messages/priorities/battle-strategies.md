This Memorial Day weekend: a message from the book of Job, not about the earthly wars we often remember at this time but about another kind of warfare entirely. We win these spiritual battles when we use God's strategies, and Cliff reveals the 3 strategies that He has given us to be victorious over the Enemy.
