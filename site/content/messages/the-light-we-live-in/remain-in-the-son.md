*As for you, what you have heard from the beginning must remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains
in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.*

-- 1 John 2:24 (NET)

This week, Scott Hetherington teaches from 1 John 2, and its strange warnings about "last hours" and "antichrists"
followed by an admonition to "remain in the Son". What's John getting at here... and what does it have to do with
Seattle snowstorm preppers?
