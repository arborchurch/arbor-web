*For this is the gospel message that you have heard from the beginning: that we should love one another.*

-- 1 John 3:11 (NET)

This week, Garrett Shelp explores 1 John 3:11–24, where John highlights a love that’s deeper than being nice—a love that began our journey, meets us in the dark, and finds us wherever we are.
