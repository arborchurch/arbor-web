*"Look! The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will name him Emmanuel," which means "God with us."*

-- Matthew 1:23 (NET)

This Advent season, join us as we explore the meaning of Jesus' name, *God with us*, and celebrate a God who is ever-present -- even in our darkest valleys.
