> Endure your suffering as **discipline**; God is treating you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline?

-- Hebrews 12:7


The word _discipline_ brings up difficult feelings for some -- it makes us think of pain, or abuse, or shame. Can discipline be good? Alison continues our series "Change is Good" with a message about the what, when, and how of God's discipline.
