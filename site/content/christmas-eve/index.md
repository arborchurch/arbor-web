<h1>UMBRELLA CHURCH</h1>

<h2>Angels We Have Heard on High</h2>

<p>
Angels we have heard on high<br />
Sweetly singing o'er the plains<br />
And the mountains in reply<br />
Echoing their joyous strains<br />
<br />
<i>Gloria in excelsis Deo</i><br />
<i>Gloria in excelsis Deo</i><br />
<br />
Shepherds why this Jubilee<br />
Why your joyous strains prolong<br />
What the gladsome tidings be<br />
Which inspire your heavenly song<br />
<br />
Come to Bethlehem to see<br />
Him whose birth the angels sing<br />
Come adore on bended knee<br />
Christ the Lord the newborn King<br />
</p>

<h2>Hark The Herald Angels Sing</h2>

<p>
Hark the herald angels sing<br />
Glory to the newborn King!<br />
Peace on earth and mercy mild<br />
God and sinners reconciled<br />
Joyful, all ye nations rise<br />
Join the triumph of the skies<br />
With the angelic host proclaim:<br />
"Christ is born in Bethlehem"<br />
Hark! The herald angels sing<br />
"Glory to the newborn King!"<br />
<br />
Christ, by highest heaven adored<br />
Christ, the everlasting Lord,<br />
Late in time behold Him come<br />
Offspring of a Virgin's womb:<br />
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,<br />
Hail the incarnate Deity<br />
Pleased as man with man to dwell<br />
Jesus, our Emmanuel<br />
Hark! The herald angels sing<br />
"Glory to the newborn King"<br />
<br />
Hail the Heaven-born Prince of Peace!<br />
Hail the Son of Righteousness!<br />
Light and life to all He brings,<br />
Risen with healing in His wings;<br />
Mild He lays His glory by<br />
Born that man no more may die<br />
Born to raise the sons of earth<br />
Born to give them second birth<br />
Hark! The herald angels sing<br />
"Glory to the new born king"<br />
</p>

<h2>Come Thou Long Expected Jesus</h2>

<p>
Come, thou long expected Jesus<br />
Born to set Thy people free;<br />
From our fears and sins release us;<br />
Let us find our rest in Thee<br />

Hope of all the earth Thou art;<br />
Dear Desire of every nation<br />
Joy of every longing heart<br />

Born a child and yet a King<br />
Born to reign in us forever<br />

By Thine own eternal Spirit<br />
Rule in all our hearts alone;<br />
By Thine all sufficient merit<br />
Raise us to Thy glorious throne<br />

Come thou long expected King<br />
Fill our hearts with gladness<br />
Come thou long expected King<br />
Fill our hearts with gladness<br />

<h2>Silent Night</h2>

<p>
Silent night, holy night<br />
All is calm, all is bright<br />
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child<br />
Holy Infant so tender and mild<br />
Sleep in heavenly peace<br />
Sleep in heavenly peace<br />
 <br />
Silent night, holy night<br />
Shepherds quake at the sight<br />
Glories stream from heaven afar<br />
Heavenly hosts sing 'Alleluia<br />
Christ the Savior is born<br />
Christ the Savior is born<br />
 <br />
Silent night, holy night<br />
Son of God, love's pure light<br />
Radiant beams from Thy holy face<br />
With the dawn of redeeming grace<br />
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth<br />
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth<br />
 <br />
Silent night, holy night<br />
Wondrous star, lend thy light<br />
With the angels let us sing<br />
Alleluia to our King<br />
Christ the Savior is born<br />
Christ the Savior is born<br />
</p>
