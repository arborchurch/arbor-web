We find and follow Jesus in GROUPS through a variety of ways...

<br />

## COMMUNITY GROUPS

Community Groups meet in homes and are made up of your local Arborites. Their intention is the same, which is to BE WITH JESUS, BECOME LIKE JESUS, and DO WHAT HE DID. This happens through prayer, serving one another, sharing life... and a meal! To belong to a group in your zip code, take the pre-req "Community Practice" this fall or winter!

<br />

## CONNECTING GROUPS

Connecting Groups meet in chunks of time called trimesters. Most are 6-8 weeks long. When you join a group, you're committing to that particular trimester
with the option to re-up as many times as you choose. The breaks in-between trimesters give new members a chance to join
and leaders time to catch their breath.

<br />

## CARE GROUPS

Care Groups offer a layer of support to those experiencing difficult seasons, and are available in various timeframes according to need.
