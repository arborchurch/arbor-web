We find and follow Jesus through GROUPS in a variety of ways. Click the sign up button to see what group might fit for you!

## GROUP DESIGN

Not all groups look alike, but their intention is the same, which is to BE WITH JESUS, BECOME LIKE JESUS, and DO WHAT HE DID. This happens through prayer, hearing Him in the Word, serving one another, sharing life... and often food!
<br />

## GROUP RHYTHMS

Groups meet in chunks of time called trimesters. Most are 6-8 weeks long. When you join a group, you're committing to that particular trimester
with the option to re-up as many times as you choose. The breaks in-between trimesters give new members a chance to join
and leaders time to catch their breath.
