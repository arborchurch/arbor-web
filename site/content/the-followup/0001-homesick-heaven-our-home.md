On The Followup Jake unpacks yesterday's message, explains his desire to talk about Heaven for 5 weeks, and discusses Chik-Fil-A sauce.

Every Monday morning we will be posting these podcasts (we like to think of them as discussions) that will dive deeper into the previous sermon. We hope that these episodes will offer you a deeper understanding, better application to your life, and that you can feel a better connection to the Pastors at Arbor Church.

You can find these discussions on Facebook, Youtube, and anywhere you listen to podcasts.
